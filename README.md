# Project-Euler
My attempt at the Project Euler Problems

There's quite a few, so we'll just have to see how far I get!

They're all quite mathetmatics based, so I'm going to be writing in python3

For these problems, occasionally some code/ideas have been borrowed from various 
blogs around the internet - I have tried to attribute all the original authors, but if
I've missed any accreditations, then just let me know!
